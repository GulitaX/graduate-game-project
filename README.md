# This is a Unity 2D game project that I had made for my graduation project at UIT-HCMC
The game is not priorited to the art, but a way for me to study, research about some Procedural Generation techniques deliver replaablity through level. 
That a key aspect to make game more diverse and attracted to player that love exploring new content.
